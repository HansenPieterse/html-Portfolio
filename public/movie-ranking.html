<h1>The Best Zac Snyder Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Watchmen</h3>
<p>As always, Zac creates very dark movies, which I love, but also has very small details that paints a graphic, but discreet picture. Watchmen did that perfectly.</p>
<h3>Justice League (Snyder Cut)</h3>
<p>This was quite a bitter-sweet movie to watch because of Josh Wetan's cut. It was supposed to be the start of something beautiful, which ended here. Still, the 4-hour cut was very emotional and dark as always and a pleasure to watch.</p>
<h3>Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice</h3>
<p>This was the ultimate man against god battle as the title suggests, but Superman's humanity, ironically was his fall. If he wanted to, Batman would be no more, but even after his mother was at play, he still put mankind first without rampage.</p>
